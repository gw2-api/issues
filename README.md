# Guild Wars 2 API Issues

This is repository acts as an community issue tracker for the Guild Wars 2 API. Maintained by the [GW2 Development Community Discord](https://discord.gg/zqeHCEg).

ArenaNet API developers do look at this issue tracker!

## Why another issue tracker?

The issue tracker ArenaNet used to have at [arenanet/api-cdi](https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi) has not been maintained since 2018. Even before that ArenaNet employes did not have time to moderate and verify issues.

This issue tracker on the other hand has the advantage of being moderated by a group of active and dedicated community members, trying uphold a high quality of issues. This makes it easier for ArenaNet to find relevant info on issues in the rare times they get to work on the API.  

## List of issues

This is the list currently [open issues sorted by +1 reactions](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). When an issue is relevant for you, please react with üëç so it can be prioritized.

## Reporting issues

Everyone can report issues here! This is the process each issue will follow:

1. First check if the issue is already reported.  
  If it is, don't open a new issue, instead add any additional relevant information to the existing issue.
2. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues/new/choose) using one of the issue templates.
3. Provide as much information as possible (follow the instructions in the template).
4. The issue will get the label "[triage](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Atriage)".
5. Someone will review the issue, asking for additional info if necessary. If the issues description is complete and the issue confirmed, it will be labeled "[confirmed](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aconfirmed)".
6. A small list of confirmed issues are manually curated into a short list for ArenaNet developers to work on.
