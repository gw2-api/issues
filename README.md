## Reporting issues

Everyone can report issues here! This is the process each issue will follow:

2. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues/new/choose) using one of the issue templates
3. Provide as much information as possible (follow the instructions in the template)
4. The issue will get the label "[triage](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Atriage)"
5. Someone will review the issue, asking for additional info if necessary. If the issues description is complete and the issue confirmed, it will be labeled "[confirmed](https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aconfirmed)"
6. A small list of confirmed issues are manually curated into a short list for ArenaNet developers to work on
